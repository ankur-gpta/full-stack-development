# How to think like a Frontend developer?

* Directly dealing with lots of browsers
* ultimately tech stack comes down to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* Component driven design and development.
* Site-level architecture / routing.
* Fetching Data, State Management, Mutating data.
* Pulling off the design.
* Making the design part of the system.
* Making sure it is accessible.
* Worrying about the performance.
* Testing things across browsers.
* Testing things across devices
* Sweating the UX.

- Slowly things are moving towards frontend.

* We may not need to think about OS and Server anymore due to Serverless.
* We may not need to think of Database too - may be headless CMS or could be on frontend.

I know Git, I write tests, I design, I know about build processes, I care about performance, I can make sites
accessible, I can set up our deployment pipeline and every other thing frontend developers already do.
